# Contributing to fortune0

fortune0 is an open incubator. We have 230+ domains looking for builders.

## How It Works

```
🟢 OPEN        → Domain accepting pitches
🔒 CLAIMED     → Someone's been selected to build
🏗️ BUILDING    → Active development
✅ LAUNCHED    → Live product
💀 ABANDONED   → Reopened for new pitches
```

## How to Apply

1. **Browse domains** at [fortune0.com/ideas.html](https://fortune0.com/ideas.html)
2. **Pick one** that matches your skills
3. **Submit your pitch** via the "Apply to Build" button
4. **We review** within 7 days
5. **If selected**, we discuss terms and you start building

## What We're Looking For

- Clear vision for what the domain becomes
- Relevant skills/experience
- Ability to ship within 30-90 days
- Willingness to work transparently

## Compensation Models

We're flexible. Options include:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Hourly | $25-100/hr depending on scope |
| Revenue Share | % of revenue the product generates |
| Equity | Ownership stake in the specific project |
| Project-Based | Fixed fee for defined deliverables |

Terms are negotiated per project.

## The Process

```
Week 1:    Pitch review + selection
Week 2:    Terms negotiation + kickoff
Week 3-8:  Build sprint (check-ins every week)
Week 9+:   Launch + iterate
```

## Rules

1. **You build, we own** - fortune0 retains the domain and core IP
2. **Transparent work** - Progress shared publicly or in private repo
3. **Can't break main** - Your work extends, doesn't destroy
4. **Ship or step aside** - If you can't deliver, domain reopens

## Domain Believer Program

Not ready to build, but want to support a domain's future? Become a **Believer**.

### What's a Believer?

A Believer is someone who sponsors a domain's renewal for another year. You don't have to build anything—you're just keeping the dream alive for someone who will.

### Why Become a Believer?

- **First look**: When the domain gets claimed, you'll be notified first
- **Revenue share**: If the domain generates revenue, believers get 5% of first-year earnings (capped at 2x your contribution)
- **Credit**: Your name on the project as an early supporter
- **Good karma**: You kept an idea alive

### How It Works

```
1. Find a domain you believe in
2. Check its expiration date
3. Pay the renewal cost (~$10-20/year for most domains)
4. We extend the domain for another year
5. You get credited as a Believer
```

### Urgency Matters

Domains expiring soon need believers most:
- 🔥 **< 30 days**: Critical
- ⏰ **< 90 days**: Soon
- ✅ **90+ days**: Safe

### Believer Tiers

| Tier | Contribution | Perks |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Seed | 1 year | First notification, 5% rev share |
| Champion | 2+ years | Above + builder veto (you can reject a pitch) |
| Guardian | 5+ years | Above + equity option if project incorporates |

### Become a Believer

Email: matt@fortune0.com with:
